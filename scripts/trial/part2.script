SPEAK_FROM COURT_JUDGE
    "Mr. O'Donovan, being a witness isn't a paying job..."

 SPEAK_FROM COURT_PROSECUTION
    "Not that anyone here is getting paid anyway..."

POSE Ross Sweaty

POSE Dan SideNormal
SPEAK_FROM COURT_ASSISTANT
    "Some friend... Testifying against Jory, treating him like a criminal."

SPEAK Arin
    "What do you mean? We don't even know if Jory is innocent!"

SPEAK Dan
    "Arin. Have you learned nothing from the Penix Wright playthrough?"

SPEAK Arin
    "That a gavel, lubed properly, has many uses?"

SPEAK Dan
    "No!"

POSE Dan SideLaugh
SPEAK Dan
    "Well, I mean yeah... That gayliff sure was creative."\

POSE Dan SideNormal
SPEAK Dan
    "But more importantly, you should go into it with confidence that your client is innocent."
SPEAK Dan
    "We don't know if he's guilty, but if his own attorney doesn't believe him, why should the rest of the court?"

SPEAK Arin
    "You're right! We're here to defend our friend, so we should at least assume we're making the right call."

SPEAK Dan
    "Also, knowing how these things go, the defendant is always innocent."

SPEAK_FROM COURT_JUDGE
    "If the defense is done sucking each other's toes, shall we begin with Mr. O'Donovan's testimony?"

POSE Arin Sweaty
THINK_FROM COURT_DEFENSE
    "Why does he act like he doesn't know anyone here?"

ANIMATION Arin Nodding 2

POSE Arin Normal
SPEAK Arin

SPEAK_FROM COURT_JUDGE
    "Alright. The witness may begin."
